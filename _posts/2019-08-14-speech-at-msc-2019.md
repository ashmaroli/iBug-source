Hello everyone, I'm iBug from the University of Science and Technology of China. Today I'll show you my experiences and tips in participating in open-source projects.

## 1. What is Open-Source Software?

Open-Source Software (OSS) is a classification of computer software whose source code is freely available. Open-source software always has a license attached to it, which defines the usage of its source code. A few common OSS licenses are GNU General Public License, MIT License, Apache 2.0 License and the BSD License. Different licenses pose different requirements to users of the source code. For example, GNU GPL requires that any derived work be licensed under the same terms, while MIT License is more permissive on that. Meanwhile, the public availability of the source code enables everyone to participate and commit their contribution.

The original incentive of open-source software was to share knowledge. Software design and programming skills are both knowledge, so the ancestors share them by sharing source code. In an open-source model, every user is part of the community. Everyone can join the development and maintenance work, or help test and audit the code, or chime in to the discussions. That's how open-source software forms its distinctive collaboration model, and its adequate documentations, tutorials as well as discussions provides abundant information to whoever wants to take a part.

Then, why do people choose open-source software?

On one hand, open-source software is well-audited. Contrary to proprietary software, open-source ones are not audited by a closed group, but rather anyone interested. Anyone can audit the code of any single open-source software, which grants open-source software with its unique transparency. Meanwhile, help from people with experiences in security also adds to the overall security of the software.

On the other hand, every open-source software has a surrounding community. The persistence of the community around open-source software makes it perpetual and less likely abandoned. In addition, the variety of people in the community makes every part of the software well-maintained. Besides, the open availability of the source code enables the obtaining of a running software by compiling from source, which brings down the total cost of using it. (It isn't unconditionally true, though, for example NGINX sells a "premium version" of the software, NGINX Plus, for a fee.)

Here's a collection of open-source software that many people recognizes, including TensorFlow ML framework, Windows Calculator, LibreOffice office suite, as well as Debian GNU/Linux operating system. It's apparent that open-source software exists throughout our daily life and work.

## 2. My experiences in participating in open-source projects

[This is my GitHub profile page](https://github.com/iBug). The 6 pinned repositories are:

- TetrisAI: A console tetris game written in C, with a built-in AI playing mode
- SmokeDetector: This one will be discussed later
- PyReversi: A GUI reversi game developed with Python and PyQt5. Also has built-in AI to provide a "human vs computer" mode
- CGadgets and vbsGadgets: As suggested by their names, they're "gadgets" written in C and VBScript
- OJSangbox: My work from the course *Research for newbies*, a sandbox implementation for online judgers using Linux technologies like chroot and rlimits.

[This is my Stack Overflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5958455/ibug). I occasionally participate in the regular Q & A activities on Stack Overflow. So far I have asked 100+ questions and answered 800+, and accrued an aggregate reputation of more then 22.6k. My top few tags include `c++`, `c` and `python`.

### My first participation in an open-source project

My first experience took place at [markondej/fm_transmitter](https://github.com/markondej/fm_transmitter). I was trying to set up my own FM radio station and loop music, when I noticed that the "repeat" command-line option wasn't working. I confirmed that there was nothing wrong with my Pi and the Raspbian OS on it, so I took a look at the code. It wasn't hard for me to spot a missing negation in a condition check, so I patched it myself, compiled the code again and verified that my patch was working correctly.

My roommate was right beside me then, and came to help me when he saw me. Under his guidance, I forked the upstream repository, pushed my local changes up, and opened [my first pull request](https://github.com/markondej/fm_transmitter/pull/61). Two days later, the author replied "Thanks for your help" and merged my PR.

### My primary participation in another open-source project

![image](/image/msc2019/s7.png)

Look at the above image again, I anticipate that the icon at bottom-right is the least known one. It's the logo of the organization [Charcoal-SE](https://charcoal-se.org), whose primary project is [SmokeDetector](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector), a headless chat bot that helps the Stack Exchange Network fight off spam.

The bot came into my attention in December 2017, and I was directed to Charcoal HQ after asking about it.

![image](/image/msc2019/s14.png)

And I dropped into that chat room. Every day I chat with them and watched the output from SmokeDetector, flagging spam that was reported. The routine continued to early January 2018, when someone noticed a bug with Smokey. I volunteered to take a look at it and fixed it, and fired up my first PR that changed some code ([#1441](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/pull/1441)). Since then, I worked hard to study the code of SmokeDetector and continued to submit a steady stream of fixes and improvements. In March 2018, they added me to their [list of developers](https://charcoal-se.org/people#devs), and in June, I was granted direct push access to the repository, indicating that I had been trusted for my proficiency in handling the project.

From SmokeDetector, I started the expansion of my contribution, and sought out for other interesting projects that I could give a hand to. One of them was [metasmoke](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke), a web dashboard for SmokeDetector, which is a Rails-based web application itself. Another one was [Charcoal website](https://charcoal-se.org), hosted on GitHub Pages and built with Jekyll. With what I learned from working on Charcoal website, I built my own website with Jekyll too, and submitted a PR to [the theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman-theme) that I started off with.

### Other contributions I've made

In addition to code patches, I also opened a series of decent issues, name a few:

- Magisk, a popular root framework for Android. I submitted [a suggestion](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/issue/512) to improve its install script, which was accepted later. (#512)
- wtfpython, a collection of interesting Python constructs. I pointed out a mistake in the document (#81)
- BaiduPCS-Go, a command-line client for Baidu Net Disk. I reported a bug. (#402)
- I also opened a few trivial issues in repositories I'm familiar with, so that more people could learn them by participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

In addition, I'm also an active participant in various discussions, as well as Stack Overflow. I enjoy helping others with my knowledge.

My personal top ★ repo is [pac](https://github.com/iBug/pac), which originated from [a discussion](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-windows/issues/1873#issuecomment-416293495) on another repository. People had a strong need for a functionality, which was implementable just with a PAC script, so I wrote one and shared it with the *pac* repo, which has accumulated a total of 24 stars by the time of writing this article. There's one thing we can know for sure, that its star amount wasn't for its complexity or use of high-tech, but rather its usefulness to passers-by. The issues section has also received a few questions, all of which has been answered by me.

### What I've learned

I'd say pretty much the primary thing I've learned from those experiences is teamwork. Teamwork is very inclusive and involves the use of Git Version Control System (VCS), a consistent coding style and documentation style, as well as the meaning and usage of a Continuous Integration system, and most importantly, the skills of communication.

## 3. Getting involved by yourself

Before chiming in, you should understand one point that an open-source project is a *project* and thus, you have flexible ways of contribution.

- For software, the most intuitive contribution is to submit code patches, for example bug fixes, enhancements and test suites.

- Besides, it's also a valuable kind of contribution to help improve documentations and tutorials

- Meanwhile, translating documents into other languages enables more people to participate.

  For example, [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) is a commonly used translation collaboration platform, and it powers many well-known projects like Disqus and SoundCloud.

- Finally, if you're not interested in all of above, you still have the option of contributing supplementary information, like Q & A and bug reports.

So then, what are we going to reap for ourselves?

- The most direct consequence is that you gained hand-on experiences working on a real-life project.

- You also practiced your existing skills and learned new ones.

- You acquired important knowledge and wisdom.

- You can easily show off your hard work on open-source projects.

- You can stand out from the crowd when applying for opportunities. Apparently, your HR / curator / mentor will more likely give you the offer when they can actually see your work.

  An immediate example is my chance of speaking here, which owes a lot to the fact that my open-source achievements can be easily seen and verified by the event host.

Looks rather attractive, right? Then it's time to set yourself up.

### 发现自己的长处

在准备参与之前，第一件事是看看自己擅长哪方面的事，有哪方面的技能。比如说，你很擅长将你的想法转化成代码；或者你擅长折腾软件，找出意想不到的 bug；或者你擅长把复杂的东西解释清楚；或者你对艺术和设计有自己独到的见解；或者你去过西方的很多国家，精通八国语言；或者你对于某些东西有不错的了解，能够帮助别人答疑解惑……

### 找到自己的兴趣

其次，你要找到一个你感兴趣的项目来参与。寻找的方向也有几种，比如

- 你日常使用的软件；
- 某天你意外看到的一个有趣的项目，比如 GitHub 首页右边栏随机推送的三个项目；
- 网络上还会时不时的有一些号召大家参与开源项目的活动，比如 [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)，以及另一个长期举行的 [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)；
- 如果你有一个好点子，你也可以自己开始一个新项目。

如果你决定加入一个现有项目的话，我建议先对这个项目做一些背景调查。

- 首先最重要的一点，开源软件一定要有协议。同时由于开源项目的开放特性，如果有一份行为准则，那就更好了；
- 其次你要判断项目的活跃程度，比如最近一次提交时间，以及项目维护者的提交频率；
- 如果项目有一个活跃的社区，那绝对是一个加分项。活跃的社区通常会产生大量的 Issues 和 Pull Requests，所以这些活动你可以考虑也检查一下；
- 最后，一个友好的社区和交流环境会让人在参与的过程中感到舒适。

### 高效沟通

在你参与项目的过程中，发生的最频繁的事件就是与其他人交流。为了提升交流效率，有几点值得注意：

- 你应该自己做足够的研究，例如提问时不要问 “怎么写 1+1 的代码”，而 “1+1 为什么出来 3” 甚至都可能是个好点的问题；
- 如果你真的要问 “1+1 为什么出来 3” 这样的问题，那么你最好能提供足够的信息让别人可以判断你的问题出在哪。同样对于其他讨论，也要确保别人有足够信息来复现你说的内容；
- 在保证信息完整的时候尽可能保持简练，比如 “这个 1+1 等于 3 的代码是我下午在码头搬完砖后去星巴克喝咖啡的时候写的” 这样的信息最好就别提供了 `:)`
- 对于公开的项目，最好能够保证讨论也是在公开的环境下进行的，除非有特别的保密需求，例如反馈安全方面的漏洞；
- 如果你的观点和其他人不一致，请尊重他们。

### 提交你的贡献之后

当你提交了你的贡献之后，就是等待项目的维护者来检查和进行下一步处理了。这里也有几种情况

- 没人理你，你的 Issue 或 PR 就那么挂在那里。这时候要么多等一会，要么再检查一下这个项目，是不是还在活跃维护的状态；
- 如果有人对你的贡献提出了改进意见，说明你的提交有人来花时间看过了。你应该尊重别人，尽早响应别人提出的意见；
- 也许有时候，项目维护者或者社区不认可你的提交，这时候也不要气馁，看看别人给出的评价和理由，作为自己的经验；
- 如果你的贡献被采纳了，那么**祝贺你**。

## 后记

不论你是第一次参与开源项目，还是一位经验丰富的老手，希望你能够再接再厉，把开源的精神继续发扬光大。
