Linux is the #1 open-source operating system nowadays, and many people are running a Linux distro, such as Ubuntu or Arch. Linux is also the most popular choice for a server OS.

Building Linux from scratch is a good way to learn how it works, and is also a good practice for whoever wanting to learn about how operating systems work. And for me, the task of the first experiment of the course *Operating System Concepts*.

# Environment setup

The lab task is to build Linux **2.6.26** and run it in [QEMU][qemu]. For the most convenient setup, I recommend the 32-bit versions of **Ubuntu 14.04** "*trusty*" or **Debian 7** "*wheezy*". If you prefer another Linux distro, make sure it comes with glibc of a version **no newer than 2.19**. This is because glibc 2.20 requires Linux kernel 2.6.32, which supercedes our target version.

There's no need to install the base system physically if you don't have one yet, as a [virtual machine](/p/15) will work perfectly well, and you can enjoy your Windows or Mac applications while the VM is running.

Before we start building, we need to have proper tools installed. On Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 7, the following command will install all we need for this lab:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev

The `build-essential` package, as suggested by its name, contains essential tools for building, such as binutils, C compiler and library, and automation tools like Make.
