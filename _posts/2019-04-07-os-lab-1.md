Linux is the #1 open-source operating system nowadays, and many people are running a Linux distro, such as Ubuntu or Arch. Linux is also the most popular choice for a server OS.

Building Linux from scratch is a good way to learn how it works, and is also a good practice for whoever wanting to learn about how operating systems work. And for me, the task of the first experiment of the course *Operating System Concepts*.

# Environment setup

The lab task is to build Linux **2.6.26** and run it in [QEMU][qemu]. For the most convenient setup, I recommend the 32-bit versions of **Ubuntu 14.04** "*trusty*" or **Debian 7** "*wheezy*". If you prefer another Linux distro, make sure it comes with glibc of a version **no newer than 2.19**. This is because glibc 2.20 requires Linux kernel 2.6.32, which supercedes our target version.

There's no need to install the base system physically if you don't have one yet, as a [virtual machine](/p/15) will work perfectly well, and you can enjoy your Windows or Mac applications while the VM is running.

Before we start building, we need to have proper tools installed. On Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 7, the following command will install all we need for this lab:

```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev
```

The `build-essential` package, as suggested by its name, contains essential tools for building, such as binutils, C compiler and library, and automation tools like Make.

# Building the Linux system

Now we're ready to build our own Linux.

## Compiling the kernel

First download and extract the source code:

```shell
wget https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.26.tar.gz
tar zxvf linux-2.6.26.tar.gz
```

Next, generate the default configuration and build against that:

```shell
cd linux-2.6.26
make i386_defconfig
make
```

You'll likely encounter a few errors during the building process. Here are the fixes to two most common errors people encounter:

The first one you'll meet should look like this:

```text
gcc: error: elf_x86_64: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [arch/x86/vdso/vdso.so.dbg] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86/vdso] Error 2
```

To fix this, open `arch/x86/vdso/Makefile` in a text editor, such as Vim or gedit. Replace `-m elf_x86_64` with `-m64` and `-m elf_i386` with `-m32`. Save the changes.

The second one would be like this:

```text
undefined reference to `__mutex_lock_slowpath'
undefined reference to `__mutex_unlock_slowpath'
```

To fix this, open `kernel/mutex.c` and look for the above two functions. You'll see them written like these:

```c
static void noinline __sched
__mutex_lock_slowpath(atomic_t *lock_count);

static noinline void __sched __mutex_unlock_slowpath(atomic_t *lock_count);
```

Insert `__used` after the keyword `static` in both cases, so they should end up looking like these:`

```c
static __used void noinline __sched
__mutex_lock_slowpath(atomic_t *lock_count);

static __used noinline void __sched __mutex_unlock_slowpath(atomic_t *lock_count);
```

For most people, fixing the above two things should enable the build process to complete without interrupts.
