I just bought an Xbox One S controller yesterday, expecting it would pair with my Android phone via Bluetooth. I have learned that the key mapping would be a bit messed up because it's a Microsoft product, and have already prepared for it by downloading a key layout file and placing it in my phone. However, it seems more stuff has changed since the tutorials found online were published.
