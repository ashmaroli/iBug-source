## Games

- [Grand Theft Auto V](https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/) - My first legal copy of game bought from Steam
- [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) - Needs no explanation! (User ID: `iBugOne`)

## Movies & TV

- *Mr. Bean* series from the 1990s
  - I particularly like the scene where Mr. Bean drives off sitting on the roof of his Mini. ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6VaYr7xOsw&t=12m11s))
- *Johnny English*, also by Rowan Atkinson
- *The Lion King* (1994), **not** the 2019-refurbished version
- *The Big Bang Theory*
