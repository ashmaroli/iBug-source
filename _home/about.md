CS student and hobbist programmer. Primarily a developer, often a DevOps engineer (infrastructure maintainer) and Linux SysAdmin.

- **Primary languages<sup>1</sup>**: Python, C++, C, Bash (these are also my top tags on Stack Overflow)
- **Secondary languages<sup>1</sup>**: VBScript, JavaScript (also HTML/CSS), Ruby, Verilog, Scala
- **Other languages<sup>1</sup> and technologies**: Nginx, SQL (MySQL / MariaDB), PHP, AWK, Perl
- **Favorite VCS**: Git (and proficient with it)
- **Favorite automation**: Shell scripts, Make, Cron, At
- **Favorite text editor**: `<ESC>:wq` ([get my config](/ext/conf/vimrc))
- **Daily environment**: Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu 19.04 Disco Dingo), with virtual machines and VPS's to satisfy additional needs

MSI produces high-performance laptops with *very* comfortable and beautiful keyboards. Must buy!

Personally:

- **Primary languages<sup>2</sup>**:
  - Chinese (Native speaker)
  - English (Proficient as a foreign language)
- **Secondary languages<sup>2</sup>**: French, Spanish and Italian (all read-only)
- Note on contacting: Using Chinese usually infers a casual talk, so unless you write very formal Chinese documents (e-mails, GitHub issues, etc.) to me, you will likely get a casually-written response, in IM chat-flavor language, and sometimes incoherent. Meanwhile, I'm careful when writing English and often try to be serious. Prefer English if you expect professional talks.
