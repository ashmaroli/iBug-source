### [OJSandbox](https://github.com/taoky/OJSandbox)
An experimental sandbox for online judgers (OJ). I am a co-author.

### [Tetris with AI](/TetrisAI)
A good game automation that you *must* try and watch!

### [SpaceRider](/SpaceRider)
An old Flash plane-shooting game that I made when I was 13. ActionScript 2.0 (so expect that it won't run very fluently on a low-end computer)

### [Human Resource Machine Programming Language](/HRM)

### [Aurora Theme](/aurora-theme)
Aurora is a clean, responsive Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

And it's the theme for my Project Pages.

### [College Physics Experiments Toolbox](/CPE-Toolbox) (incomplete)
A set of tools made to make College Physics Experiments easy!
